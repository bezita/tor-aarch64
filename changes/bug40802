  o Minor bugfixes (directory authorities):
    - After we added layer-two vanguards, directory authorities wouldn't
      think any of their vanguards were suitable for circuits, leading
      to a "Failed to find node for hop #2 of our path. Discarding
      this circuit." log message once per second from startup until
      they made a fresh consensus. Now they look to their existing
      consensus on startup, letting them build circuits properly from
      the beginning. Fixes bug 40802; bugfix on 0.4.7.1-alpha.
