  o Minor bugfixes (relay flag usage):
    - Fix client usage of the MiddleOnly flag so that MiddleOnly relays are
      not used as HS IP or RP by clients or services. Additionally, give
      dirauths the ability to remove specific flags, as an alternative to
      MiddleOnly. Fixes bug 41023; bugfix on 0.4.7.2-alpha
